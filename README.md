# Instacart-Basket-Analysis
Analyzing Instacart sales patterns to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation.

In this project, I analyzed online grocery store sales data from Instacart to inform a targeted marketing strategy. I combined data sets about orders, products, and (fictional) customers and used Python and the pandas library to uncover information about sales patterns and customer behavior. I also used the matplotlib and seaborn libraries to create some data visualizations. These results were used to answer various business questions and create recommendations regarding marketing strategy.

The data about orders and products comes from Instacart and can be accessed at https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017 (note that prices have been fabricated for the purpose of this project). Fictional data about customers was created by CareerFoundry for the purpose of this project.
